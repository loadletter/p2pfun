Create a list of urls to download without a bittorrent client
from a torrent with webseeds (currently only picks the first webseed set)

$ python extract.py mydata.torrent > urllist.txt
$ wget -x -H -c -i urllist.txt

Description:
 -x : create directory structure
 -H : turn on timestamps
 -c : resume interrupted downloads
 -i : get urls from file
